Characteristics of Cloud :
        Scalability 
        Simplicity 
        Cost Effective
        Enhance Automation

Models of Cloud Computing :
        Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        Software as a Service (SaaS)

Security Aspects in Cloud Data Lifecycle :
        Create/Update :
                Implementing SSL/TLS
                Encryption
                Secure connections
        Store :
                Encryption
                Backup
        Use :
                Secure connections
                Secure platform ( secure authentication mechanism )
                Restrict Permissions
                Secure Virtualisation
        Share :
                Jurisdiction
                Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
        Archive :
                Encryption
                Physical Security
                Location
                Backup Procedure
        Destroy :
                Crypto shredding :
                        A process in which encrypted data is useless by destroying cryptographic keys
        
Cloud security : 
        Security through access management: 
                Ensure that the right people should perform the right job within the right set of permissions.
        Security through policies: 
                Set conditions and guidelines under which users & resources can perform specific actions.
        Security through networking: 
                Ensure that cloud instances remain safe from network-oriented attacks.
        Security through storage management: 
                Ensure the security of sensitive data stored in cloud storage through various means, including encryption and geographical settings, etc.
        Essential concepts like security through logging, Disaster Recovery & Backup, the importance of updates, etc.
