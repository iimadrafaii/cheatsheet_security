Defences :
        It is difficult to defend against the attacks staged against external dependencies since there 
        are so many and new vulnerabilities are found daily. However, there are certain things that 
        we can do to limit the risk:
        
        Make sure to update and patch dependencies on a regular basis. This would include emergency 
        patching of dependencies if a sufficiently serious vulnerability was discovered.
        
        Dependencies can sometimes be copied and hosted internally. This will reduce the attack surface.
        
        Sub-resource Integrity can be used to prevent tampered JS libraries from loading. In the HTML 
        include, the hash of the JS library can be added. Modern web browsers will verify the hash of 
        the JS library, and if it does not match, the library will not be loaded.


We should be considering the following :
        Be aware of the dependencies you use in your applications and systems. Also, be aware that these 
        dependencies may have dependencies, which will grow the list of dependencies you will need to keep tabs on.

        Make sure to always use the latest versions of dependencies, both internal and external dependencies. 
        More often than not, these updates to dependencies are not to introduce new features but to fix existing 
        issues and bugs.

        It is not just the dependencies themselves that should be considered for security, but also how we 
        configure and use our dependency managers, especially for internal dependencies.

        Dependencies and dependency management systems should be included in the attack surface of the application 
        or system we are developing.
