Defences :
        It is difficult to defend against the attacks staged against external dependencies since there 
        are so many and new vulnerabilities are found daily. However, there are certain things that 
        we can do to limit the risk:
        
        Make sure to update and patch dependencies on a regular basis. This would include emergency 
        patching of dependencies if a sufficiently serious vulnerability was discovered.
        
        Dependencies can sometimes be copied and hosted internally. This will reduce the attack surface.
        
        Sub-resource Integrity can be used to prevent tampered JS libraries from loading. In the HTML 
        include, the hash of the JS library can be added. Modern web browsers will verify the hash of 
        the JS library, and if it does not match, the library will not be loaded.
