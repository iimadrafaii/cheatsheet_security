IaC = Infrastructure as Code

An IaC approach can make it possible to have a reliable infrastructure that is scalable, 
versionable, and repeatable.


It supports key concepts :
    Continuous Integration :
        Infrastructure development to be a collaborative process with versioning 
        in place.
    Continuous Deployment :
        Allowing for the automation of infrastructure deployment across multiple 
        environments consistently.

Declarative vs. Imperative :
    Declarative :
        It focuses on the what rather than the how.
        This involves declaring an explicit desired state for your infrastructure.
        A state file is kept to ensure your infrastructureâ€™s current state matches the desired state.
    Imperative :
        This approach involves defining specific commands to be run to achieve the desired state
