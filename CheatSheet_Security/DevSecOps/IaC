IaC = Infrastructure as Code

An IaC approach can make it possible to have a reliable infrastructure that is scalable, 
versionable, and repeatable.


It supports key concepts :
        Continuous Integration :
                Infrastructure development to be a collaborative process with versioning 
                in place.
        Continuous Deployment :
                Allowing for the automation of infrastructure deployment across multiple 
                environments consistently.
