VCS = Version Control Systems

All data are stored in .git

Staging is the “pre-commit” state in git

Git data storage :
        When a file hash is 345e6aef713208c8d50cdea23b85e6ad831f0449
        Git stores every version of a file as a blob
        The two chars from the front (34) are used as a directory
        ==> stored at .git/objects/34/5e6aef713208c8d50cdea23b85e6ad831f0449
        To see the content of a git blob :
                git cat-file blob 345e6aef713208c8d50cdea23b85e6ad831f0449
        The blob, tree, and commits are how Git stores the complete history of your repository. 
        It does all the references by the object hash: there is no way of manipulating the history 
        or files tracked in the repository without breaking the relations.

Clone a repo :
        git clone <repository_url>

Specify a branch to clone :
        git clone -branch name_of_branch <repository_url>

Git branches are lightweight, making branching operations fast and switching between branches quickly.
