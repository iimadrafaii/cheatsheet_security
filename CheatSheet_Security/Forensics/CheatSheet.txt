FTK Imager :   a forensics tool that allows forensic specialists to acquire computer data and perform analysis 
               without affecting the original evidence preserving its authenticity, integrity, and validity 
               for presentation during a trial in a court of law.

Chain of custody :   is a legal concept used to track the possession and handling of evidence from the time it’s 
                     collected at a crime scene to the moment it’s presented in court. The chain of custody is 
                     documented through a series of written records that track the evidence’s movement and who 
                     handled it at each step.

Types of forensic image acquisition:

      Static acquisition   : A bit-by-bit image of the disk is created while the device is turned off.
      Live acquisition     : A bit-by-bit image of the disk is created while the device is turned on.
      Logical acquisition  : A select list of files is copied from the seized device.
      Sparse acquisition   : Select fragments of unallocated data are copied. The unallocated areas 
                             of the disk might contain deleted data; however, this approach is limited 
                             compared to static and live acquisition because it doesn’t cover the whole disk.

Encryption in Smart Phones : 
      Android 4.4 introduced full-disk encryption. 
      Android 7.0 introduced Direct Boot, a file-based encryption mode.
      Android 9.0 and higher can encrypt an SD card as it would encrypt internal storage.

A Faraday bag prevents the phone from receiving any wireless signal.

Tools for analysing Android phones : Android Debug Bridge (adb) and Autopsy Digital Forensics.
