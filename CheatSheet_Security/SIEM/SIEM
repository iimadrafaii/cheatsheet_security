SIEM = Security Information and Event Management

A Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) is a tool used 
to collect, index, and search data from various endpoints and network locations

SIEMs are typically architected with three components used for searching, indexing, and load-balancing; 
These components are commonly known as the search head, indexer, and forwarder, respectively.

Data ingestion :
        How data arrives from a device to the indexer
        Types of data ingestion :
                Agent/forwarder
                Port-forwarding
                Syslog
                Upload

Data storage : 
        Cold storage : Accessed rarely and not really performant but does the job.
        Warm storage
        Hot  storage : Data accessed often and requires higher performance
