Network Device (= Router, load balancers, ...) : 
        used to control and manage network resource ( vs Endpoint Devices = laptops, ... )

General Techniques : 
        Updating & Patching
        Disabling unnecessary services & ports
        Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)
        Logs Monitoring
        Backup regularly
        Enforcing Strong Passwords
        Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Removal/Blocking of Insecure Protocols

Implementation of Monitoring and Logging Controls :
        Syslog
        SNMP
        NetFlow
        Packet Captures

Hardening Virtual Private Networks ( SEE VPN HARDENING ) 

Hardening Routers, Switches & Firewalls :
        Setting up the device ( timezone, logging ... )
        Change default credentials
        Enable secure network protocols
        Disabling unnecessary scripts
        Securing Wi-Fi: If the router has Wi-Fi capabilities, securing the Wi-Fi by 
                        enabling strong encryption like WPA2/WPA3, disabling SSID 
                        broadcast, changing default passwords, and more.
        Manage traffic rules
        Monitor traffic
        Configuring port forwarding
        Monitoring scheduled tasks
        Update firmware
        Configuring port security : limiting the number of MAC addresses registered on a switch port
        Preventing ARP spoofing : enabling static ARP tables and implementing MAC address filtering
        Preventing rogue DHCP servers : 
                Configuring static DHCP binding and ensuring no unknown devices are added to a network 
                through network mapping tools
        Enabling IPv6 : built-in support of IPsec
