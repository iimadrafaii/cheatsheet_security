Request and Response - FTP : 
        Control Connection 
                To send and receive commands
        Data Connection :
                After authentication, this connection is used for transferring data (files and folders)

FTP has two modes:
# Active Mode :
        The FTP client connects to the FTP server at TCP port 21 to establish a command connection.
        The FTP server connects to the FTP client at TCP port 20 to establish a data connection. 
# Passive Mode :
        The client establishes the control and data connections
        The client sends the PASV command to the server
        The server sends a random port to the client

Request and Response - FTPS :
        Implicit Connection :
                Both command and data channels are secured automatically with SSL encryption
        Explicit Connection :
                You can choose which channel to encrypt ( Command and/or data )

The standard port for FTP and Explicit FTPS is 21, whereas it is 990 in the case of Implicit FTPS

In a passive FTP connection, the first command that the client send over the command channel is : PASV
