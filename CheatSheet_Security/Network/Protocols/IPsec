IPsec uses the following protocols : 
        Authentication Header (AH)
        Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
        Security Association (SA)

# Authentication Header (AH) :
The protocol is responsible for the authentication and the integrity of the traffic; 
however, it cannot protect the confidentiality of the data.
It has two modes : 
        Transport Mode :
                Provides authentication for the TCP/UDP header and data
        Tunnel Mode : 
                Provides authentication for the IP header, TCP/UDP header, and data


# Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) :
Provides encryption in addition to authentication and integrity. 
It works in two modes:
        Transport Mode :
                Provides security (confidentiality and integrity) for the TCP/UDP header and data
        Tunnel Mode: 
                Provides security (confidentiality and integrity) for the IP header, TCP/UDP header, and data
