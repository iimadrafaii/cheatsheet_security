SMTP is an “Email Push Protocol” commonly used to transfer emails from an SMTP client to an SMTP server.

Two models :
        SMTP End-to-End : 
                The sender-side SMTP client initiates an SMTP connection to the recipient’s SMTP server
        SMTP Store-and-Forward :
                The SMTP server will maintain the copy of the mail within itself (store)
                until the copy is forwarded to the receiver.

SMTP Components :
        User Agent (UA) : 
                Responsible for creating the email message and sending it to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
        Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) :
                MTA will transfer the email from the UA to the recipient MTA across the Internet 
                (often, the MTA and Mail Delivery Agent are hosted on the same server).

POP3 is used to download email messages from the server to the client.

For encryption, the STARTTLS command is used between the email client and the email server.
