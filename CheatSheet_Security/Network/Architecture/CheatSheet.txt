The connection between the switch and router is known as a trunk.

VLANs are configured to communicate with a router through a designated interface of a switch, known as a switch port.

Security, optimization, and redundancy should all be considered when designing a network, ideally without compromising one component.

DMZ : Separates untrusted networks or devices from internal resources.

"Security zones" and access controls will physically direct how and where traffic goes.

ACL : Access Control List
ACE : Access Control Entry

Firewalls : stateless vs stateful

SSL/TLS Inspection : Uses an SSL proxy to intercept protocols, including HTTP, POP3, SMTP, or other SSL/TLS encrypted traffic. Once intercepted, the proxy will decrypt the traffic and send it to be processed by a UTM (Unified Threat Management) platform. UTM solutions will employ deep SSL inspection, feeding the decrypted traffic from the proxy into other UTM services, including but not limited to web filters or IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), to process the information.

Addressing Common Attacks : 
# DHCP Snooping : ( a security feature that acts like a firewall between untrusted hosts and trusted DHCP servers )
                  Was introduced to combat rogue DHCP servers; it will validate and rate-limit 
                  DHCP traffic as necessary. If a host is untrusted, its traffic will be 
                  filtered and rate-limited.

# Dynamic ARP Inspection : ( a security feature that validates Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets in a network )
                  Let's recap; the DHCP binding database provides the expected MAC and IP address pair of 
                  untrusted hosts; ARP inspection will compare the source IP address and MAC address to 
                  the binding pair; if they are mismatched, it will drop the packet.
