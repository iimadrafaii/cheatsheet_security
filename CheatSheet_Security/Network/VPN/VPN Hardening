Use strong encryption algorithm : 
        AES-256-CBC is typically considered one of the strongest cipher encryption nowadays

Keep VPN gateway software up-to-date :
        sudo apt upgrade openvpn

Implement strong authentication :
        auth directive ( SHA1, SHA128, SHA256, SHA512 and MD5 )

Change default settings :
        Change the default usernames and passwords

Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) :
        ( To generate a new key : sudo openvpn --genkey --secret my.key )
        The tls-crypt directive requires a key.

Dedicated Users for VPN Server :
        Limit user access by creating a dedicated user account and group with restricted 
        permissions specifically for running the OpenVPN server.
