# Physical : 
Adding a GRUB ( a bootloader ) password.
GRUB is not available for systems deployed using cloud service providers (as you donâ€™t have access to the physical terminal).

LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup).
Access a file encrypted with LUKS : sudo cryptsetup open --type luks secretvault.img myvault && sudo mount /dev/mapper/myvault myvault/ 

# Configuring Firewall ( ufw )

# Remote Access :
Protecting Against Password Sniffing : 
      Using ssh instead of telnet.
Protecting Against Password Guessing :
      Disable remote login as root; force login as non-root users.
      Disable password authentication; force public key authentication instead :
            PubkeyAuthentication yes to enable public key authentication
            PasswordAuthentication no to disable password authentication

# Securing user accounts : 
Use sudo : have an account created for administrative purposes added to the sudoers.

Disable Unused Accounts : 
      Change shell for the user in /etc/passwd to /sbin/nologin 
Disable shells for local services : Set the shell to sbin/nologin for all the local 
                                    service accounts such as www-data, mongo, and nginx,
