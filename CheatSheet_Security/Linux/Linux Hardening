# Physical : 
Adding a GRUB ( a bootloader ) password.
GRUB is not available for systems deployed using cloud service providers (as you donâ€™t have access to the physical terminal).

# Filesystem Partitioning and Encryption :
LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup).
Access a file encrypted with LUKS : sudo cryptsetup open --type luks secretvault.img myvault && sudo mount /dev/mapper/myvault myvault/ 

# Configuring Firewall ( ufw )

# Remote Access :
Protecting Against Password Sniffing : 
      Using ssh instead of telnet.
Protecting Against Password Guessing :
      Disable remote login as root; force login as non-root users.
      Disable password authentication; force public key authentication instead :
            PubkeyAuthentication yes to enable public key authentication
            PasswordAuthentication no to disable password authentication

# Securing user accounts : 
Use sudo : have an account created for administrative purposes added to the sudoers.
Disable root : A straightforward way is to modify the /etc/passwd and change the root shell to /sbin/nologin.
Enforce a Strong Password Policy : The libpwquality library.
Disable Unused Accounts : 
      Change shell for the user in /etc/passwd to /sbin/nologin 
Disable shells for local services : Set the shell to sbin/nologin for all the local 
                                    service accounts such as www-data, mongo, and nginx, 
                                    to name a few.

# Software and Services :
Disable Unnecessary Services
Block Unneeded Network Ports ( set firewall rules )
Avoid Legacy Protocols
Remove Identification Strings : 
            Whenever you connect to a remote server, it usually replies with 
            its version number. This information would reveal various information 
            to the attacker, such as the name of the server/program, the version 
            number, and the host operating system.
Update and Upgrade Policies :
            Select distributions that will continue to receive updates smoothly for many years.
            apt update
            apt upgrade
            Kernel Updates ( 2016 Dirty COW attack )

Audit and Log Configuration : ( /var/log )
            tail -n 12 boot.log
            grep FAILED boot.log
