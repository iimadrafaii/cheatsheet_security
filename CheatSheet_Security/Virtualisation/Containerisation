Namespace : The kernel feature that allows for processes to use resources of the Operating 
            System without being able to interact with other processes

In a normal configuration containers can't interact with each other
(unless they share the same namespace)

Processes and containers :
            Namespaces essentially segregate system resources such as processes, files and memory away from other namespaces.

            Every process running on Linux will be assigned two things:
                        A namespace
                        A process identifier (PID)

Put simply, the process with an ID of 0 is the process that is started when the system boots. 
Process numbers increment and must be started by another process, so naturally, the next process 
ID will be #1. This process is the systems init , for example, the latest versions of Ubuntu use 
systemd. Any other process that runs will be controlled by systemd (process #1).
