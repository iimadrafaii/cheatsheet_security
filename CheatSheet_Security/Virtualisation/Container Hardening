Protecting the Docker Daemon :
        Interact with remote Daemon using SSH and creating contexts in docker :
                docker context create --docker host=ssh://myuser@remotehost --description="Development Environment" development-environment-host 
        ==> Switch to the newly created context : 
                docker context use development-environment-host
        Exit current docker context : 
                docker context use default


Implementing Control Groups :
        Control Groups (also known as cgroups) are a feature of the Linux kernel that facilitates 
        restricting and prioritising the number of system resources a process can utilise.

        ( this helps prevent faulty or malicious containers from exhausting a system )

        Setting CPUs limits : in core counts 
                docker run -it --cpus="1" mycontainer

        View information about a container : ( 0 means no limits !)
                docker inspect containername
