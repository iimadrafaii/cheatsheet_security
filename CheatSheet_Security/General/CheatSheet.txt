 CIA security triad : 
    Confidentiality
    Integrity
    Availability


Going one more step beyond the CIA security triad, we can think of:
    Authenticity
    Nonrepudiation ( ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data ) 


DAD Triad: 
    Disclosure 
    Alteration
    Destruction/Denial


Foundational security models :
    Bell-LaPadula Model : can be summarized as “write up, read down.” ( aims to achieve confidentiality )
    Biba Model : can be summarized as “read up, write down.” ( aims to achieve integrity )
    Clark-Wilson Model : (aims to achieve integrity)
    ... and many other models ...


ISO : The International Organization for Standardization

ISO/IEC 19249 lists five architectural principles:
    Domain Separation
    Layering
    Encapsulation
    Redundancy
    Virtualization

ISO/IEC 19249 teaches five design principles:
    Least Privilege
    Attack Surface Minimisation
    Centralized Parameter Validation
    Centralized General Security Services
    Preparing for Error and Exception Handling


Two security principles that are of interest to us regarding trust : 
    Trust but Verify
    Zero Trust
