 CIA security triad : 
    Confidentiality
    Integrity
    Availability


Going one more step beyond the CIA security triad, we can think of:
    Authenticity
    Nonrepudiation ( ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data ) 


DAD Triad: 
    Disclosure 
    Alteration
    Destruction/Denial


Foundational security models :
    Bell-LaPadula Model : can be summarized as “write up, read down.” ( aims to achieve confidentiality )
    Biba Model : can be summarized as “read up, write down.” ( aims to achieve integrity )
    Clark-Wilson Model : (aims to achieve integrity)
    ... and many other models ...


ISO : The International Organization for Standardization

ISO/IEC 19249 lists five architectural principles:
    Domain Separation
    Layering
    Encapsulation
    Redundancy
    Virtualization

ISO/IEC 19249 teaches five design principles:
    Least Privilege
    Attack Surface Minimisation
    Centralized Parameter Validation
    Centralized General Security Services
    Preparing for Error and Exception Handling


Two security principles that are of interest to us regarding trust : 
    Trust but Verify
    Zero Trust


SIEM : Security Information and Event Management. ( aggregates log data from multiple sources and analyses it for signs of security threats )


Governance: Managing and directing an organisation or system to achieve its objectives and ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and standards.
Regulation: A rule or law enforced by a governing body to ensure compliance and protect against harm.
Compliance: The state of adhering to laws, regulations, and standards that apply to an organisation or system.

Benefits of implementing governance and regulation :
   More Robust Security Posture
			Increased Stakeholder Confidence
			Regulatory Compliance
			Better alignment with business objectives
			Informed decision-making
			Competitive advantage


Relevant Laws and Regulations : 
   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
   Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)
   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)


General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) :
   Prior approval must be obtained before collecting any personal data.
   Personal data should be kept to a minimum and only collected when necessary.
   Adequate measures are to be adopted to protect stored personal data.


International Standards/Frameworks : 
   ISO 27001
   NIST 800-53
   NIST Special Publication 800-63B
   Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC 2)


# Threat modelling :
	Threat : Cyber attacks, human error, or natural disasters.
	Vulnerability : A weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that may be exploited by a threat to cause harm.
	Risk : Likelihood of being compromised because of a threat taking advantage of a vulnerability.

## Threat modelling Frameworks :

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework : (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)
### DREAD [Microsoft] : (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability)
### STRIDE [Microsoft] : (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
### PASTA : Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
