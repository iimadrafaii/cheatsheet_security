Incident Response and Management

Alert VS Incident :
        An alert's severity must be high enough to become an incident.

Incident Response :
        What happened ?
        Understand the scope of the incident

Incident Management :
        How do we respond to what happened ?


Levels of Incidents Response and Management :
        Level 1 : SOC Incident
        Level 2 : CERT Incident
        Level 3 : CSIRT Incident
        Level 4 : CMT Incident

The Process of Incident Management :
        Preparation :
                Identify and document key stakeholders and call trees that will be used during an incident
                Create and update playbooks that aid the team in following a set process for incidents with a known nature
                Exercise the team's ability to deal with an incident through tabletop exercises and cyber war games
                Continuously perform threat hunting to help create new alert rules based on modern attacker techniques
        Detection and Analysis ( and Triage ) :
                The triage step is responsible for determining the severity of the incident
        Containement
        Eradication
        Recovery
        Post-Incident Activity

Common Pitfalls During an Incident :
        Insufficient Hardening
        Insufficient Logging
        Insufficient Determination of Incident Scope
        Insufficient Accountability
        Insufficient Backups

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created a document called Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving, that provides the following volatility order with reasoning :
        Registers and Cache
        Routing Table, ARP Cache, Process Table, Kernel Statistics and Memory
        Temporary File Systems
        Disk
        Remote Logging and Monitoring
        Physical Configuration and Network Topology
        Archival Media

The Other Two Big DON'Ts :
        Don't trust the programs on the system
        Don't run programs that modify the access times of files

Chain of custody : A term used to describe ensuring that evidence can be used in legal proceedings

Some tasks that an engineer may have :
        Creating playbooks 
        Creating call trees

Playbook : Process that the blue team follows during an incident.
Call tree : The structure used to inform all the relevant parties about the incident.

Isolation of the Incident :
        Containment
        Eradication
        Recovery
