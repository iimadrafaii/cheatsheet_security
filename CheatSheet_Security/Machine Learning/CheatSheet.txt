# Neural networks :

## Learning Styles :
### Supervised learning :
        We ask for answer and provide feedback for the correct answer ( so it improves itself ).
        We need labelled dataset : we have a label for what the correct answer should be, given 
        the input.
### Unsupervised learning :
        Often used to allow neural networks to learn interesting features that humans can't 
        comprehend that can be used for classification

## Layers : 
        Input layer.
        Hidden layer.
        Output layer.

## How it works : 
        Inputs are multiplied by a weight value first. The output is entered into an activation function. 
        (this decides if the neuron (node) will be active or not. It does this by ensuring that the output, 
        no matter the input, will always be a decimal between 0 and 1 (or between −1 and 1).)

## Training Neural network :
### Feed-Forward Loop : ( the only step in a normal use of the neural network ) 
    Normalise all of the inputs
    Feed the inputs to our nodes in the input layer
    Propagate the data through the network
    Read the output from the network

### Back-Propagation : ( only present in a training )
    Calculate the difference in received outputs vs expected outputs
    Update the weights of the nodes
    Propagate the difference back to the other layers


## Dataset Splits :
    Training data ( 70–80% )
    Validation data ( 10–15% )
    Testing data ( 10–15% )


Python code to create neural netwwork : 
    scikit-learn

GIGO : garbage in, garbage out. This term is meant to illustrate that AI isn't this magical thing that can fix every single problem. 
An ML structure is only as good as the quality of the data used to train it. Without good data, we wouldn't be able to receive any accurate output.

# Machine Learning Pipeline :
    Data Collection
    Data Preprocessing
    Train/Test Split dataset
    Model Training
    Model Evaluation
    Testing the Model
    

CNN  ( Convolutional Neural Networks ) :
    Feature extraction :
        Two steps : 
            Convolution : Summarise the image (the input) ( mathematically ==> kernel matrix )
            Pooling : Summarise the image (the input) statistically ( take the max for ex of every 2x2 )
    Fully connected layers.
    Classification.
