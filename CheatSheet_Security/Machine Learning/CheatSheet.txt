Examples of ML :
    Genetic algorithm
    Particle swarm
    Neural networks


Neural networks :
    Learning Styles :
        Supervised learning :
            We ask for answer and provide feedback for the correct answer ( so it improves itself ).
            We need labelled dataset : we have a label for what the correct answer should be, given 
            the input.
        Unsupervised learning :
            Often used to allow neural networks to learn interesting features that humans can't 
            comprehend that can be used for classification
    Layers : 
        Input layer.
        Hidden layer.
        Output layer.
