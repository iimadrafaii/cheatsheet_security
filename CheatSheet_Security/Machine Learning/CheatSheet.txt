Examples of ML :
    Genetic algorithm
    Particle swarm
    Neural networks


Neural networks :
    Learning Styles :
        Supervised learning :
            We ask for answer and provide feedback for the correct answer ( so it improves itself ).
            We need labelled dataset : we have a label for what the correct answer should be, given 
            the input.
        Unsupervised learning :
            Often used to allow neural networks to learn interesting features that humans can't 
            comprehend that can be used for classification
    Layers : 
        Input layer.
        Hidden layer.
        Output layer.
    How it works : 
        Inputs are multiplied by a weight value first. The output is entered into an activation function. (this decides if the neuron (node) will be active or not. It does this by ensuring that the output, no matter the input, will always be a decimal between 0 and 1 (or between âˆ’1 and 1).)
