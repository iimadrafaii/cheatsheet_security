Examples of logic flaws include:

    Excessive trust in client-side controls

    Failing to handle unconventional input :
        Are there any limits that are imposed on the data?
        What happens when you reach those limits?
        Is any transformation or normalization being performed on your input?

    Making flawed assumptions about user behavior:
        Users won't always supply mandatory input : 
            When probing for logic flaws, you should try removing each parameter in turn and observing what effect this has on the response. 
            You should make sure to:
            Only remove one parameter at a time to ensure all relevant code paths are reached.
            Try deleting the name of the parameter as well as the value. The server will typically handle both cases differently.
            Follow multi-stage processes through to completion. 
            Sometimes tampering with a parameter in one step will have an effect on another step further along in the workflow.
