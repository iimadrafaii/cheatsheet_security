Examples of logic flaws include:

    Excessive trust in client-side controls

    Failing to handle unconventional input :
            Are there any limits that are imposed on the data?
            What happens when you reach those limits?
            Is any transformation or normalization being performed on your input?

    Making flawed assumptions about user behavior

    Domain-specific flaws

    Providing an encryption oracle
