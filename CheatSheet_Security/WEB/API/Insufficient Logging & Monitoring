Ensure use of the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log management. 

Keep track of all denied accesses, failed authentication attempts, and input validation 
errors, using a format imported by SIEM and enough detail to identify the intruder.

Handle logs as sensitive data and ensure their integrity at rest and transit. Moreover, implement custom alerts to detect suspicious activities as well.
