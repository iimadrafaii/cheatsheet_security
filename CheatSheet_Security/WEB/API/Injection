Ensure to use a well-known library for client-side input validation.

If a framework is not used, all client-provided data must be validated first and then filtered and sanitised. 

Add necessary security rules to the Web Application Firewall (WAF). Most of the time, injection flaws can be mitigated at the network level.

Make use of built-in filters in frameworks like Laravel, Code Ignitor etc., to validate and filter data.
