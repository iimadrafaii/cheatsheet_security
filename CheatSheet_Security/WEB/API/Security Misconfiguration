Several factors can result in security misconfiguration, including improper/incomplete default 
configuration, publically accessible cloud storage, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and 
error messages displayed with sensitive data.

# Mitigations :
Limit access to the administrative interfaces for authorised users and disable them for other users. 

Disable default usernames and passwords for public-facing devices (routers, Web Application Firewall etc.).

Disable directory listing and set proper permissions for every file and folder. 

Remove unnecessary pieces of code snippets, error logs etc. and turn off debugging while the code is in production.
