Ensure complex passwords with higher entropy for end users.

Do not expose sensitive credentials in GET or POST requests.

Enable strong JSON Web Tokens (JWT), authorisation headers etc.

Ensure the implementation of multifactor authentication (where possible), account lockout, or a captcha system to mitigate brute force against particular users. 

Ensure that passwords are not saved in plain text in the database to avoid further account takeover by the attacker.
