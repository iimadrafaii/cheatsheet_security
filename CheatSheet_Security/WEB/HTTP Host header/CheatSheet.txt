Supply an arbitrary Host header

Check for flawed validation:
    ADD Bad alpha/num PORT in the Host Header : vulnerable-website.com:BAD-STUFF
    Specify a vulnerable(hacked) sub domain: hacked-subdomain.vulnerable-website.com
    Create new domain that contains the value of the old one : notvulnerable-website.com

Send ambiguous requests:
    Inject duplicate Host headers
    Supply an absolute URL : GET https://vulnerable-website.com/ HTTP/1.1
    Add line wrapping : indent one of the 'Host' headers in the request ( it may be ignored by one server and not the other )
    

Inject host override headers:
    X-Forwarded-Host
    X-Host
    X-Forwarded-Server
    X-HTTP-Host-Override
    Forwarded
