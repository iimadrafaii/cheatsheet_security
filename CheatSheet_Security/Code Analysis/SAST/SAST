SAST = Static Application Security Testing

SCA = Software Composition Analysis
==> used to scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities
( track and analyse any open-source component brought into a project )

The different analysis techniques commonly used by SAST tools :
        Semantic analysis
        Dataflow analysis
        Control flow analysis
        Structural analysis
        Configuration analysis

Tools :
        Psalm (PHP Static Analysis Linting Machine)

SAST can be implemented in one of the following ways :
        CI/CD integration: 
                Each time a pull request or a merge is made, SAST tools will check the code for vulnerabilities.
                On some occasions, SAST scans only at merges ...
        IDE integration
