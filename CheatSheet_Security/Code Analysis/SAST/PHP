Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks are made possible by the misuse of one of the following functions in PHP:
        require()	
        include()	
        require_once()	
        include_once()

MySQL : 
        mysqli_query()
        mysql_query()
        mysqli_prepare()
        query()
        prepare()
